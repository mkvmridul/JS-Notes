/*

JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

Everything in JS happens in a Execution context which have two components
1. memory (key: value) [variable environment]
2. code [thread of execution]



How JS works?

When we execute a js file, the global execution context is created, then the operation happens in two phases (memory creation ) & ()
In memory creation phase we allocate the memory space to the said variables, constants,functions etc with undefined value but in case of functions we copy the entire function block.
